    <h1>Financial Analysis and Planning Tool</h1>
    <p>
      I want to create a tool for my personal financial recording and
      planning. The first phase of this project will be to learn how to accept
      document submissions from a user and store them in a database. This will
      also involve creating, registering, deleting, and logging in users. Next,
      I need to parse the data in the form and classify expenses under a 
      variety of groups. Revenue can also be classified, but there are few 
      revenue sources compared with expense sources. This data will be stored 
      over time, allowing useful analysis of spending habits and overall 
      financial wellbeing. Create data visualization tools. Based on past data
      and goals for the short and long term, come up with recommendations for 
      monthly spending allowance in each category. Use CSS to make the site
      more user friendly.
